Summary: because of a passion in programming


I used to be a mechanical engineer who worked in the oil and gas industry. The downturn of the oil price has driven thousands of people out of employment and I am one of them. But with my great interest and experience in programming, I started working at a software developer at a startup IT company. The world is brand new to me and I'm learning great things everyday. 

Then one day I decided that I should start tracking down my learning progress. It could be useful for my own personal reference and also benefit people who is or will be taking a similar path to become a programmer. Hence I started this blog. Harry, signing off on Nov 19, 2016.

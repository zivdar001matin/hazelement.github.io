<h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of trying to solve impossible problems, he would more often challenge the assumptions so we could simply work around then. "How should we do this?" -&gt; "Why do we need to do it at all?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask questions often before take actions. This can help us avoid unnecessary tasks/work. </p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal, not all efforts translate into impact. </p>
<p>An effective engineer, therefore, is defined by the rate at which he or she produces value per unit of time worked. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A prime example is over engineering. There is no need to build something that can support millions of users when only a handful of people will use it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a useful framework, leverage, for analyzing the effectiveness of different activities</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="part-1-adopt-the-right-mind-set">Part 1: adopt the right mind set</h1>
<h2 id="focus-on-high-leverage-activities">Focus on high-leverage activities</h2>
<p><span class="math">\(Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pareto principle (80-20 rule). For many activities, 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work. That 20% comprises the high leverage activities, activities that produce a disproportionately high impact for a relatively small time investment. </p>
<p>Investing in programs to ramp up new engineers as quickly and as seamlessly as possible was one of the highest-leverage activities that we could have done. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a place to organize your tricks and lesson learned. Invest time to write up wiki how a software is designed at high level. </p>
<p>Debugging is important and allows new engineers to step through the code and understand it's execution. And more importantly, it helps them to find root cause of problems on their own. </p>
<p>There are 2 ways to provide instructions for debugging. A text based wiki page with command and code examples, or a video recording. </p>
<h3 id="increase-leverage-in-3-ways">Increase leverage in 3 ways</h3>
<p>Leverage can only be increased in three different ways. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity</li>
<li>By increasingly the output of a particular activity</li>
<li>By shifting to higher-leverage activities</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This translates to 3 questions we ask ourselves about any activity we're working on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?</li>
<li>How can I increase the value produced by this activity?</li>
<li>Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Some actual examples</p>
<p>Meeting, you might have a 1-hour meeting scheduled with your team to review progress on a project</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?
Defaulting to a half hour meeting in stead of a 1-hour meeting to get the same amount done in less time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I increase the value produced by this activity?
    Prepare an agenda and a set of goals for the meeting and circulating them to attendees beforehand so that the meeting is focused and more productive. </p>
</li>
<li>Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?
    If an in-person discussion isn't necessary, replacing the meeting with an email discussion and spending the time building an important feature instead. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you successfully 
1. shorten the time required for an activity
2. increase its impact
3. shift to a higher-leverage activity</p>
<p>You become a more effective engineer. </p>
<h3 id="direct-energy-towards-leverage-points-not-just-easy-wins">Direct energy towards leverage points, not just easy wins</h3>
<p>Don't confuse high-leverage activities with easy wins. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as a lever lets you apply a small amount of force over a long distance to generate a much larger force, so too do many high-leverage activities requires consistent applications of effort over long time periods to achieve high impact. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>User leverage to measure your engineering effectiveness.</strong> focus on what generates the highest return on investment for your time spent. </li>
<li><strong>System magically increase the leverage of your time.</strong> Find ways to get an activity done more quickly, to increase the impact of an activity, or to shift to activities with higher leverage. 
-<strong>Focus your effort on leverage points.</strong> Time is your most limited asset. Identify the habits that produce disproportionately high impact for the time you invest. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optimize-for-learning">Optimize for learning</h2>
<h3 id="adopt-a-growth-mindset">Adopt a growth mindset</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How we view our own effectiveness impacts how much effort we invest in improving it. </p>
<p>People with a <em>fixed mindset</em> believe that "human qualities are carved in stone" and they're born with a predetermined amount of intelligence. 
People with a <em>growth mindset</em> believe that they can cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort.</p>
<p>They may initially lack aptitude in certain ares, but they view challenges and failures as opportunities to learn. These mind set influences whether people take advantage of opportunities to improve their skills. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's like leveling up in a games. These challenges and difficulties help you to gain experience in life. And you level up from them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A growth mindset means accepting responsibilities for each aspect of a situation that you can change - anything from improving your conversational skills to mastering a new engineering focus - rather than blaming failures and shortcomings on things outside your control. It means taking control of your own story. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="invest-in-your-rate-of-learning">Invest in your rate of learning</h3>
<p>Compounding leads to exponential growth. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Learning follows an exponential growth</li>
<li>The earlier that you optimize for learning, the more time your learning has to compound</li>
<li>Due to compounding, even small deltas in your own learning rate make a big difference over the long time. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>About easy daily jobs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When companies pay you for cushy and challenging 9-to-5 jobs, what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. 
When you realize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. You get complacent and stall. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever feel boring and you are wasting your life at a boring/safe company. That's exactly this. and your brain is warning you.</p>
<h3 id="seek-work-environments-conducive-to-learning">Seek work environments conducive to learning</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we ensure that beyond the initial learning curve, the work environment remains one where we can sustainably learn new things day after day?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These 6 factors vary from company to company and team to team. And important to you also changes through out your career. When switching teams or jobs, make sure you are asking the right questions to find out i they are a good fit and give you opportunities to continue to grow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast growth<ol>
<li>how fast is the user base, revenue growing?</li>
<li>how aggressive has the company been hiring in the past year</li>
<li>how quickly have the strongest team members grown into leadership</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Training<ol>
<li>does new member have formal mentorship? </li>
<li>what does the company do to ensure team members continue to learn and grow</li>
</ol>

<li>what tools does the team use to increase iteration speed</li>
<li>how long does it take to bring and idea to launch?</li>
<li>what percentage time is spent on maintenance/operation vs developing new product and features'</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People<ol>
<li>surrounding yourself with people who are smarter, more talented, and more creative than you.</li>
<li>Do the people who interviewed you seem smarter than you?</li>
<li>Are there skills they can teach you?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Autonomy<ol>
<li>Do people has autonomy to choose what projects they work on and how do they do them?</li>
<li>how often do individuals switch teams or projects</li>
<li>Do engineers participate in discussions on  product design and influence product direction?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dedicate-time-on-the-jobs-to-develop-new-skills">Dedicate time on the jobs to develop new skills</h3>
<p>20% time from google: dedicate 30 min or 1 hour everyday to invest into your own growth. Make investments to make you more effective in the long run. </p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a deeper understanding of ares you're already working on. </li>
<li>Attend training sessions (or adhoc training videos)</li>
<li>Read other team's design docs</li>
<li>Implement scripts to help your daily work</li>
<li>Gain experience in adjacent disciplines</li>
<li>infra engineer -&gt; machine learning, database internals, or web development</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>10 suggestions to take advantage of resources available to you at work</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers at your company</li>
<li>Write more code</li>
<li>Go through any technical, education material available internally</li>
<li>Master the programming language that you use</li>
<li>Send your code reviews to the harshest critics</li>
<li>Enroll in classes on areas where you want to improve</li>
<li>Participate in design discussion of projects you're interested in. (Don't wait for an invitation, ask for it)</li>
<li>Work on a diversity of projects</li>
<li>Make sure you're on a team with at least a few senior engineers whom you can learn from. </li>
<li>Jump fearlessly into code you don't know. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="always-be-learning">Always be learning</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I improve? How could I have done this better? What should I learn next to best prepare me for the future?
Continual learning is inextricably linked with increased happiness. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>10 starting points to help inspire a habit of learning outside of the workplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn new programming languages and frameworks</li>
<li>Invest in skills that are in high demand</li>
<li>Read books</li>
<li>Join a discussion group</li>
<li>Attend talks, conferences, and meetups</li>
<li>Build and maintain a strong network of relationships</li>
<li>Follow bloggers who teach</li>
<li>Write to teach</li>
<li>Tinker on side projects</li>
<li>Pursue what you love</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-takeaways_1">Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Own your story</li>
<li>Don't shortchange your learning rate</li>
<li>Find work environments that can sustain your growth</li>
<li>Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills</li>
<li>Locate learning opportunities outside of the workplace</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prioritize-regularly">Prioritize regularly</h2>
<h3 id="track-to-dos-in-a-single-easily-accessible-list">Track to-dos in a single, easily accessible list</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A single master list is better than an assortment of sticky notes, sheets of paper, and emails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't try to rank all items in the list with a priority value. There are 2 reasons</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't have perfect information at time of evaluation. These evaluations will be off. </li>
<li>As we start evaluating, there will be new information available and new tasks added. This will invalidate our previous evaluation and we need to fix them. This will never end the evaluation. </li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>proper</strong> way to prioritize is to compare what you are doing right now vs other items in the list. and ask yourself this question, <em>Is there something else I could be doing that's higher leverage?</em>. If not, continue on your current path. If yes, it's time to rethink what you're doing. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goa isn't to establish a total ordering of all your priorities, since any ordering you make will be based on imperfect information; instead, it's to continuously shift your top priorities toward the ones with the highest leverage, given the information you have. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how do you determine if something else has higher leverage than what you're doing?</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-what-directly-produces-value">Focus on what directly produces value</h3>
<p>At end of the day, what matters is how much value you've created. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on tasks that directly bring a product closer to launch; that directs increase the number of users, customers or sales; or that directly impact the core business metrics your team is responsible for. 
When you get the important things right, the small things often don't matter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would you spend time to save $1 on grocery shopping vs searching for cheaper plane tickets and saving a few hundred dollars on your next trip?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prioritize the ones that produce the most value with the least amount of effort. </p>
<p>The corollary to focusing on the activities that directly produce value is to defer and ignore the ones that don't. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn to say know when co-worker schedules you for an unnecessary meeting, a manager assigns you a small bug. Explain how these things will detract from your other tasks and explain why the other tasks have higher priority. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't try to get everything done. Focus on what matters-and what matters is what produces value. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Items in Quadrant 2 are very important to scale in the long term but always ignored. Because they usually don't have a deadline and there is no urgency. </p>
<p>A good practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>When add items to your todo list, assign them a Quadrant number</li>
<li>De-prioritize Quadrant 3 and 4 activities that aren't important</li>
<li>Be wary of spending too much time on Quadrant 1. They usually means under investment in Quadrant 2. </li>

<p><em>if-then</em> plan, in which we identify ahead of time a situation where we plan to do a certain task. Possible scenarios could be "if it's after my 3 pm meeting, then I'll investigate this long-standing bug". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't have to be a specific time. It could also be when I have 20 mins free time, I will do xxx - maintain a list of tasks that can be finished within 20 mins, and that don't require a big chunk of uninterrupted time</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<ol>
<li>finishing a code review</li>
<li>writing interview feedback</li>
<li>responding to emails</li>
<li>investigating a small bug</li>
<li>writing an isolated unit test</li>

<p>If you never break anything, you're probably not moving fast enough. </p>
<p>because learning compounds, the sooner you accelearate your iteration speed, the faster your learning rate will be. </p>

<h3 id="invest-in-time-saving-tools">Invest in time saving tools</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A very good indicator of uture success is if the first thing someone did on a problem was to write a tool. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time-saving tools pay off large dividends. </p>
<p>Faster tools also get used more often, and they also enables new workflows that aren't possible without these tools. The positive effects compound. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not sufficient to find or build a time-saving tool. To maximize its benefits, you also need to increase its adoption across your team. The best way to accomplish that is by proving that the tool actually saves time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, it will be costly for others to pick up the new tool because they need to learn it. In these cases, it's worth to invest in additional effort to lower the switching cost and make it easier for others to use. </p>
<p>Proving to people that your tools saves time can also earn your leeway with your manager and your peers to explore ideas in the future. </p>
<p>Start small, iterate and demonstrate its value. </p>
<h3 id="shorten-your-debugging-and-validation-loops">Shorten your debugging and validation loops</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>WHen you're already using a workflow that works, albeit with a few extra steps, it's easy to get complacent and not expend the mental cycles on devising a shorter one. Don't fall into this trap! The extra investment in setting up a minimal debugging workflow can help you fix an annoying bug sooner and with less headache. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you find yourself repeated going through the same motions when you're fixing a bug or iterating on a feature, pause. Take a moment to think whether you can tighten that testing loop. it could save you time in the long run. </p>

<p>Obtaining approval from key decision maker, typically an executive at the company. There are usually less frequent communication channels. Best we can do is to work around them. Focus on securing buy-in as soon as possible. Organize reoccurring/weekly meetings to solicit early and frequent feedback. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't wait till after you've invested massive amounts of engineering time to seek final project approval. </p>

<ul>
<li>prioritize bulding prototypes, collecting early data, conducting user studies</li>
<li>explicitly ask the decision makers what they care about the most</li>

<li>average slipped project overruns its time budget by 70%</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-accurate-estimate-to-drive-project-planning">Use accurate estimate to drive project planning</h3>
<ul>
<li>An estimate, reflects our best guess about how long or how much work a project will take</li>
<li>A target, captures a desired business goal. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Engineers create estimates, and managers and business leaders specify target</p>
<p>Project schedules often slip because we allow target to alter the estimate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, we should use estimates to inform project planning. </p>
<ul>
<li>is it more important to hold the date constant and deliver what is possible?</li>
<li>or to hold the feature set constant and push back the date until all features can be delivered?</li>
</ul>
<p>Producing accurate estimates is required to make this decision?</p>
<p>How to produce accurate estimate:</p>
<ul>
<li>decompose the project into granular tasks. If a task will take more than 2 days, decompose it further</li>
<li>estimate based on how long tasks will take, not on how long you or someone else wants the to take</li>
<li>think of estimates as probability distributions, not best-case scenarios</li>
<li>let the person doing the actual task make the estimate</li>
<li>beware of anchoring bias, a low initial estimate can set an initial anchor that makes it hard to establish a more accurate estimate later on. </li>
<li>use multiple approaches to estimate the task, bottom up estimation vs past similar project estimations</li>
<li>beware the mythical man-month, don't assume that adding more people will shorten a project timeline</li>
<li>validate estimates against historical data</li>
<li>use time boxing to constrain tasks that can grow in scope. Plan to allocate a fixed amount of time, or a time box, to open-ended activities. </li>
<li>Allow others to challenge estimates</li>
<li>measure the time it took vs estimation, and learn whether we tend to under estimate or overestimate</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="budget-for-the-unknown">Budget for the unknown</h3>
<p>Typical issues that we don't estimate or account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a unit test harness for new codebase, writing our own mocking and assertion libraries for testing</li>
<li>develop a set of style guidelines before writing so much code</li>
<li>get interrupted by a few high-priority ondemand deals</li>
<li>firefighting scalability problems as more user gets onboard</li>
<li>lose an early engineer mid-project, necessitating a large amount of knowledge transfer and work redistribution</li>
<li>organization priority change</li>
</ul>
<p>Distractions like them delays project in the long term.</p>
<p>Separate estimated work time from calendar time. A month of estimated work takes longer than one calendar month to complete. </p>
<p>When setting schedules, build in buffer time for the unexpected interruptions. </p>
<h3 id="define-specific-project-goals-and-measurable-milestones">Define specific project goals and measurable milestones</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What frequently causes a project tos lip is a fuzzy understanding of what constitutes success
Define specific goals for a project based on the problem you're working to solve, and then use milestones to measure progress on those goals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A well-defined goals has 2 concrete benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>provides an important filter for separating the must-haves from the nice-to-haves in the task list. it helps defined against feature creep. </li>
<li>build clarity and alignment across key stakeholders</li>
<li>helps team members be more accountable for local tradeoffs that might hurt global goals, eg. adding more test coverage. Is this necessary for us to deliver the project? can it be done afterwards?</li>
</ul>
<p>Set milestones along the project. They act as checkpoints for evaluating the progress of a project and as channels for communicating the team's progress to the rest of the organization. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we fall behind, they provides opportunities to revise our plan, either by extending the deadline or by cutting tasks. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reduce-risk-early">Reduce risk early</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Effectively executing on a project means minimizing the risk that a deadline might slip and surfacing unexpected issues as early as possible. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tackling the riskiest areas first helps us identify any estimation errors associated with them. It's better to find them out earlier and plan accordingly than later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal from beginning of project planning should be to maximize learning and minimize risk. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another risk is system integration towards end of project, which always takes longer than planned. One effective strategy is to build end-to-end scafolding and do system testing earlier. </p>
<p>A few benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>force you to think more about the necessary glue between systems, which can help redefine the integration estimates</li>
<li>if something breaks the end-to-end system during development, you can fix it along the way, rather than scrambling to tackle it at the end</li>
<li>amortizes the cost of integration throughout the development process. It helps build a stronger awareness of how much integration work is actually left</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approach-rewrite-projects-with-extreme-caution">Approach rewrite projects with extreme caution</h3>
<p>A few risk w hen rewriting projects</p>
<ul>
<li>they share the same project planning and estimations difficulties as other projects</li>
<li>we typically underestimate rewrite projects more drastically than a new area</li>
<li>it's easy and tempting to bundle additional improvements into rewrite, why not do refactor instead?</li>
<li>any new features added must be duplicated across existing version and new versions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Second system effect. The general tendency is to over design, using all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first one. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We increase the project complexity in this case. These second systems are susceptible to schedule delays as a result of over confidence. </p>
<p>2 optios to handle it:</p>
<ol>
<li>rewrite system incrementally - refactoring. It may increase overall amount of work but the reduced risk is often worth it. </li>
<li>Rewrite system in phases - eg. Phase 1, pure refactor into new language. Phase 2, fixing bugs after new service is running in new language. Set specific goals. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dont-sprint-in-the-middle-of-a-marathon">Don't sprint in the middle of a marathon</h3>
<p>why sprint won't help to deliver a delayed project</p>
<ul>
<li>hourly productivity decreases with additional hours worked</li>
<li>you're probably more behind schedule than you think</li>
<li>additional hours can burn out team members</li>
<li>working extra hours can hurt team dynamics</li>
<li>communication overhead increases as the deadline looms</li>
<li>the sprint toward the deadline incentives technical debt</li>
</ul>
<p>When a small dose of ovetime is necessary to hit a key deadline, we need to secure buy-in from everyone on the team. </p>
<ul>
<li>making sure everyone understands the primary causes for why the timeline has slipped thus far</li>
<li>developing a realistic and revised version of the project plan and timeline, define milestones to detect whether the new plan falls behind</li>
<li>being ready to abandon the sprint if you slip even further from the revised timeline. Cut your losses. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-takeaways_5">Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>

<li>new hires to make sure they are meeting our coding standards</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="manage-complexity-through-abstraction">Manage complexity through abstraction</h3>
<p>right abstraction increase engineering productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>reduces the complexity of the original problem into easier-to-understand primitives</li>
<li>reduces future application maintenance and makes it easier to apply future improvements</li>
<li>solves the hard problems once and enables the solutions to be used multiple times</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstraction trade offs, time saved by abstraction for future engineers needs to outweigh the time invested. Focus on core functions that the team heavily relies on, such as logging, authentication etc. </p>
<p>Good abstractions should be</p>
<ul>
<li>easy to learn</li>
<li>easy to use even without documentation</li>
<li>hard to misuse</li>
<li>sufficiently powerful to satisfy requirements</li>
<li>easy to extend</li>
<li>appropriate to the audience</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing good abstractions take work, study other good ones to learn</p>
<ul>
<li>find popular abstractions in your codebase at work or from public repositories</li>
<li>look through the open source projects at big tech. Learn why abstractions like Protocol Buffers, Thrift, Hive, and MapReduce have been indispensible to their growth</li>
<li>Study the interfaces of popular APIs developed by Parse, Strip, Dropbox, Facebook, and Amazon Web Services. </li>

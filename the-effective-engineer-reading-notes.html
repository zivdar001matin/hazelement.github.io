<h1>Foreword</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of trying to solve impossible problems, he would more often challenge the assumptions so we could simply work around then. "How should we do this?" -&gt; "Why do we need to do it at all?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask questions often before take actions. This can help us avoid unnecessary tasks/work. </p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal, not all efforts translate into impact. </p>
<p>An effective engineer, therefore, is defined by the rate at which he or she produces value per unit of time worked. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A prime example is over engineering. There is no need to build something that can support millions of users when only a handful of people will use it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a useful framework, leverage, for analyzing the effectiveness of different activities</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Part 1: adopt the right mind set</h1>
<h2>Focus on high-leverage activities</h2>
<p><span class="math">\(Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pareto principle (80-20 rule). For many activities, 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work. That 20% comprises the high leverage activities, activities that produce a disproportionately high impact for a relatively small time investment. </p>
<p>Investing in programs to ramp up new engineers as quickly and as seamlessly as possible was one of the highest-leverage activities that we could have done. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a place to organize your tricks and lesson learned. Invest time to write up wiki how a software is designed at high level. </p>
<p>Debugging is important and allows new engineers to step through the code and understand it's execution. And more importantly, it helps them to find root cause of problems on their own. </p>
<p>There are 2 ways to provide instructions for debugging. A text based wiki page with command and code examples, or a video recording. </p>
<h3>Increase leverage in 3 ways</h3>
<p>Leverage can only be increased in three different ways. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity</li>
<li>By increasingly the output of a particular activity</li>
<li>By shifting to higher-leverage activities</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This translates to 3 questions we ask ourselves about any activity we're working on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?</li>
<li>How can I increase the value produced by this activity?</li>
<li>Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Some actual examples</p>
<p>Meeting, you might have a 1-hour meeting scheduled with your team to review progress on a project</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?
Defaulting to a half hour meeting in stead of a 1-hour meeting to get the same amount done in less time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I increase the value produced by this activity?
    Prepare an agenda and a set of goals for the meeting and circulating them to attendees beforehand so that the meeting is focused and more productive. </p>
</li>
<li>Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?
    If an in-person discussion isn't necessary, replacing the meeting with an email discussion and spending the time building an important feature instead. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you successfully 
1. shorten the time required for an activity
2. increase its impact
3. shift to a higher-leverage activity</p>
<p>You become a more effective engineer. </p>
<h3>Direct energy towards leverage points, not just easy wins</h3>
<p>Don't confuse high-leverage activities with easy wins. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as a lever lets you apply a small amount of force over a long distance to generate a much larger force, so too do many high-leverage activities requires consistent applications of effort over long time periods to achieve high impact. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>User leverage to measure your engineering effectiveness.</strong> focus on what generates the highest return on investment for your time spent. </li>
<li><strong>System magically increase the leverage of your time.</strong> Find ways to get an activity done more quickly, to increase the impact of an activity, or to shift to activities with higher leverage. 
-<strong>Focus your effort on leverage points.</strong> Time is your most limited asset. Identify the habits that produce disproportionately high impact for the time you invest. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Optimize for learning</h2>
<h3>Adopt a growth mindset</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How we view our own effectiveness impacts how much effort we invest in improving it. </p>
<p>People with a <em>fixed mindset</em> believe that "human qualities are carved in stone" and they're born with a predetermined amount of intelligence. 
People with a <em>growth mindset</em> believe that they can cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort.</p>
<p>They may initially lack aptitude in certain ares, but they view challenges and failures as opportunities to learn. These mind set influences whether people take advantage of opportunities to improve their skills. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's like leveling up in a games. These challenges and difficulties help you to gain experience in life. And you level up from them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A growth mindset means accepting responsibilities for each aspect of a situation that you can change - anything from improving your conversational skills to mastering a new engineering focus - rather than blaming failures and shortcomings on things outside your control. It means taking control of your own story. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Invest in your rate of learning</h3>
<p>Compounding leads to exponential growth. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Learning follows an exponential growth</li>
<li>The earlier that you optimize for learning, the more time your learning has to compound</li>
<li>Due to compounding, even small deltas in your own learning rate make a big difference over the long time. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>About easy daily jobs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When companies pay you for cushy and challenging 9-to-5 jobs, what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. 
When you realize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. You get complacent and stall. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever feel boring and you are wasting your life at a boring/safe company. That's exactly this. and your brain is warning you.</p>
<h3>Seek work environments conducive to learning</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we ensure that beyond the initial learning curve, the work environment remains one where we can sustainably learn new things day after day?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These 6 factors vary from company to company and team to team. And important to you also changes through out your career. When switching teams or jobs, make sure you are asking the right questions to find out i they are a good fit and give you opportunities to continue to grow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast growth<ol>
<li>how fast is the user base, revenue growing?</li>
<li>how aggressive has the company been hiring in the past year</li>
<li>how quickly have the strongest team members grown into leadership</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Training<ol>
<li>does new member have formal mentorship? </li>
<li>what does the company do to ensure team members continue to learn and grow</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Openness<ol>
<li>is the team open to discussions on design and give feedbacks?</li>
<li>how is knowledge documented and shared across the company</li>
<li>what are examples of lessons that the team has learned</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pace<ol>
<li>fast pace and iterate quickly</li>
<li>what tools does the team use to increase iteration speed</li>
<li>how long does it take to bring and idea to launch?</li>
<li>what percentage time is spent on maintenance/operation vs developing new product and features'</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People<ol>
<li>surrounding yourself with people who are smarter, more talented, and more creative than you.</li>
<li>Do the people who interviewed you seem smarter than you?</li>
<li>Are there skills they can teach you?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Autonomy<ol>
<li>Do people has autonomy to choose what projects they work on and how do they do them?</li>
<li>how often do individuals switch teams or projects</li>
<li>Do engineers participate in discussions on  product design and influence product direction?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Dedicate time on the jobs to develop new skills</h3>
<p>20% time from google: dedicate 30 min or 1 hour everyday to invest into your own growth. Make investments to make you more effective in the long run. </p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a deeper understanding of ares you're already working on. </li>
<li>Attend training sessions (or adhoc training videos)</li>
<li>Read other team's design docs</li>
<li>Implement scripts to help your daily work</li>
<li>Gain experience in adjacent disciplines</li>
<li>infra engineer -&gt; machine learning, database internals, or web development</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>10 suggestions to take advantage of resources available to you at work</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers at your company</li>
<li>Write more code</li>
<li>Go through any technical, education material available internally</li>
<li>Master the programming language that you use</li>
<li>Send your code reviews to the harshest critics</li>
<li>Enroll in classes on areas where you want to improve</li>
<li>Participate in design discussion of projects you're interested in. (Don't wait for an invitation, ask for it)</li>
<li>Work on a diversity of projects</li>
<li>Make sure you're on a team with at least a few senior engineers whom you can learn from. </li>
<li>Jump fearlessly into code you don't know. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Always be learning</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I improve? How could I have done this better? What should I learn next to best prepare me for the future?
Continual learning is inextricably linked with increased happiness. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>10 starting points to help inspire a habit of learning outside of the workplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn new programming languages and frameworks</li>
<li>Invest in skills that are in high demand</li>
<li>Read books</li>
<li>Join a discussion group</li>
<li>Attend talks, conferences, and meetups</li>
<li>Build and maintain a strong network of relationships</li>
<li>Follow bloggers who teach</li>
<li>Write to teach</li>
<li>Tinker on side projects</li>
<li>Pursue what you love</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Own your story</li>
<li>Don't shortchange your learning rate</li>
<li>Find work environments that can sustain your growth</li>
<li>Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills</li>
